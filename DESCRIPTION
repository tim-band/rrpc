Title: Minimal HTTP Server Allowing Calls from JavaScript to R
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Tim",
           family = "Band",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "t.band@ucl.ac.uk")
Description: Serves a WebSocket allowing JavaScript to talk to
    your R functions and optionally serve static files as an HTTP
    server. In this way you can build a web server over your R
    functionality like you can with Shiny, but here your UI must
    be written in JavaScript, not R. For information on the browser
    code required to call your R code from JavaScript, please see
    the home page listed below.
Depends: R (>= 2.15.1)

    jsonlite (>= 1.6.1),
